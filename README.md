# bml

BML, or "Buffer Manipulation Language", is an interpreter for programatically processing or generating images/gifs using a simple, easy-to-learn C-like language.

## Repo structure

This repository is a monorepo for BML and the BML runtime itself (in `/bml`) and a Slack Bot (`/slackbot`) which interfaces with BML.

For trying out BML, usage is documented in `/bml/README.md`.
